# UniNest

UniNest is an all‑in‑one campus platform with a primary focus on canteen automation. Our first milestone is to digitize and streamline food service operations; additional student‑life modules will follow iteratively.

## Objectives
- Shorter queues and faster service
- Reduced food waste through demand forecasting
- Clear campus communications and utilities added over time
- Simple, accessible UX for students and staff

## Core Feature: Canteen Automation
- Digital menu with prices and availability
- Pre‑order, scheduled pickup, and online payments
- Order status and ready notifications
- Kitchen dashboard for batching and prep
- Basic inventory signals (low/out of stock)
- Demand prediction (AI) to optimize prep and reduce waste
- Feedback and meal ratings to improve offerings
- Analytics for peak hours and popular items

## Additional Modules (added over time)
- Notice Board: exams, transport, fees, holidays; filters and alerts
- Campus‑only Chat: verified users, channels, basic moderation
- Weather Alerts: local snapshot and severe weather warnings
- Lost & Found: post, search, resolve
- Smart Timetable: today’s classes, room numbers, personal schedule
- Exam & Deadline Countdown: track items and receive reminders

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Auth, canteen basics (menu, ordering, payments, notifications)
- Phase 2: Notice Board, Lost & Found, Timetable, Countdown
- Phase 3: Chat, analytics enhancements, integrations

## Tech Overview (planned)
- Frontend: Web (React or similar); mobile later
- Backend: Node.js (REST + WebSockets)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Integrations: Payment, Weather, Email/Push

## Tone & Design Principles
- Clear over clever
- Fewer clicks
