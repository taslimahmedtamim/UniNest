# UniNest
UniNest is an all‑in‑one campus platform with a primary focus on canteen automation. We will ship canteen features first, then add other student‑life modules iteratively.

## Why UniNest?
- One app instead of many systems
- Shorter queues and faster canteen service
- Reduced food waste via demand forecasting
- Clear campus information and simple reminders

## Core Feature: Canteen Automation
- Digital menu with prices and availability
- Pre‑order, scheduled pickup, and online payments
- Order status and ready notifications
- Kitchen dashboard for batching and prep
- Inventory signals (low/out of stock)
- AI‑driven demand prediction to reduce waste
- Feedback and meal ratings to improve offerings
- Analytics for peak hours and popular items

## Additional Modules (iterative)
- Notice Board: exams, transport, fees, holidays; filters and alerts
- Campus‑only Chat: verified users, channels, basic moderation
- Weather Alerts: local snapshot and severe weather warnings
- Lost & Found: post items, search, resolve
- Smart Timetable: today’s classes, room numbers, personal schedule
- Exam & Deadline Countdown: track items and receive reminders

## Roadmap
- Phase 1: Auth, canteen basics (menu, ordering, payments, notifications)
- Phase 2: Notice Board, Lost & Found, Timetable, Countdown
- Phase 3: Chat, analytics enhancements, integrations

## Development Model (Agile)
- Iterative, incremental delivery in short sprints
- Frequent releases and user feedback
- Backlog reprioritized as we learn; canteen automation remains the main focus

## Tech Overview (planned)
- Frontend: Web (React or similar); mobile later
- Backend: Node.js (REST + WebSockets)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Integrations: Payment, Weather, Email/Push

## Tone & Design Principles
- Clear over clever
- Fewer clicks
- Helpful defaults (auto reminders)
- Ship small, iterate
